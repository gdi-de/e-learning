Metadata Specifications
================

This section presents an overview of metadata standards that are used extensively in the geospatial industry.


ISO 19115-1:2014
-------------

The ISO 19115-1:2014 Standard defines the schema required for describing geographic information resources such as datasets and services by means of metadata. The standard provides information about the identification, quality, extent, spatio-temporal aspects, content, spatial reference system, and other characteristics of geographic information resources.

EO-GeoJSON
-------------

The OGC EO Dataset Metadata GeoJSON(-LD) Encoding Standard describes a GeoJSON and JSON-LD encoding for Earth Observation (EO) metadata for datasets (granules). The metadata encoding defined in the standard satisfies the following design goals:

* Feature-based GeoJSON model: The model maximizes reuse of pre-existing standardized property names. 
* Simplicity: The standard provides a simpler, overarching exchange format integrating comments from the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) community.
* Multiple use cases: The metadata model supports metadata for an acquisition, for a simple product derived from one acquisition, or for a synthetic product.
